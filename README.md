# Py Me Up, Charlie

This project consists of two main programs: **PyBank** and **PyPoll** 

## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.jpg)

* In this challenge, we are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. Using a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

* Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll

![Vote-Counting](Images/Vote_counting.jpg)

* In this challenge, we are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

* Using a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Both folders has python script `main.py` which performs the analytics on the correspoding data sets,budget_data.csv and election_data.csv respectively.

To run each the scripts navigate to the concered folder on Terminal or CMD and simply run `python main.py`.

This is a Python 3.x project.
